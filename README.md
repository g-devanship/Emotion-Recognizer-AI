# Emotion AI: Facial Keypoint & Emotion Detection

## üìå Overview

Emotion Recognizer AI, or Artificial Emotional Intelligence, is a branch of AI focused on understanding human emotions using non-verbal cues like facial expressions and body language. This project uses deep learning to perform:

1. Facial Keypoint Detection ‚Äì Predicting coordinates of important facial landmarks.
2. Facial Emotion Classification ‚Äì Classifying facial expressions into discrete emotion categories.

## üß† Project Objectives

- Build a system that detects facial keypoints and classifies emotions from facial images.
- Train two separate models using deep learning: one for landmark detection, another for emotion classification.
- Deploy models using TensorFlow Serving for real-time inference.

## üåê Model Deployment

### üîß Using TensorFlow Serving

Steps to deploy:
1. Export model in TF Serving-compatible format.
2. Assign a model name and version directory.
3. Run TF Serving with:
   ```bash
   tensorflow_model_server \
     --rest_api_port=8501 \
     --model_name=emotion_ai \
     --model_base_path="/models/emotion_ai/"
